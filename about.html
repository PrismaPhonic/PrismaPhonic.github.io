        <p>I began mastering my friends music for fun, and eventually was convinced by them that I ought to start charging for my work. A few years down the road of this and I built a professional studio from the ground up, and have been mastering albums for predominantly electronic musicians for the past eight years in the joy of a beautifully built studio, using pristine custom designed analog eqs, compressors and processors.</p>
        <p>I started out many years ago as an electronic musician myself, and as a result understand the impact and spacial style of modern electronic music.  I use a variety of sonic tools to enhance clarity and shape the warmth and dynamics of a recording, delivering a strong emotional impact that will leave your fans dancing with a new-found connection to your music.</p>
        <p>I have a deep passion for Mastering and finds joy in enhancing other artists music.  My process is intensely focused on enhancing the emotional impact of music, and ensuring that your music is received well by listeners in all kinds of environments, from car stereos and headphones, to large sound systems at music festivals.  Your music will always translate well after it leaves PrismaPhonic.</p>
